# cse593
This is a Graduate Applied Project (CSE 593), supervised by [Dr. Yinong Chen](http://www.public.asu.edu/~ychen10/), [Arizona State University](http://asu.edu).

## Project Owner
John K. Hines, [Arizona State University](http://asu.edu)

Master of Science in Engineering Sciences - [Software Engineering](https://asuengineeringonline.com/online-degrees/engineering-science-software-engineering-mse), May 2017

## Project Goals
This project is intended to allow the gathering of data representing sleep duration, noise exposure, and dietary intake of children with Down syndrome. Its goal is to allow parents to measure a child's behavior relative to these factors. Ideally, over time, parents can use this data combined with prescriptive guidance for children with DS to predict and improve the child's quality of life.
